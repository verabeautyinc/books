# CHAPTER 6: Concerning the DIY Prosumers

In the vast, unregulated digital landscape, a new and deeply concerning trend has taken root: the rise of do-it-yourself (DIY) aesthetic treatments. On the surface, it looks like empowerment — a way for individuals to take the reins on their transformation. Beneath it, however, runs a current of risk, fueled by information abundance without the guardrails of safety.

The obsession isn't a caricature of recklessness. Much of the time, they are intelligent, resourceful, and deeply motivated. They may be priced out of professional treatments, frustrated by long waits, or disillusioned by an industry that can feel more commercial than caring. They are often fiercely self-directed — seeking control over their appearance with the same determination others reserve for mastering a skill or running a marathon. The problem isn’t the desire itself but where that desire gets channeled when trustworthy care feels inaccessible.

The DIY movement is a mirror — reflecting how strong the human urge is to reclaim control over our faces and bodies, and how quickly that urge can outpace caution. This chapter is an invitation to pause, to see both the temptation and the cost, and to reconsider what “doing it yourself” really needs to mean. Our goal is to meet these individuals where they are, provide the clear safety boundaries they may lack, and offer a structured, trustworthy alternative that can serve as a map back toward safe, genuine enhancement.

## **The New DIY Movement**

Evidence of this movement is everywhere. On TikTok, under hashtags like #DIYFiller, viewers watch short clips of individuals injecting their own lips with substances bought from unregulated overseas suppliers — sometimes reaching hundreds of thousands of views in hours. On YouTube, self-proclaimed beauty “gurus” give step-by-step instructions for using at-home plasma pens to burn away skin tags, or demonstrate deep microneedling with dangerously long needles. Reddit’s private threads, along with invite-only Facebook groups, contain detailed sourcing for black-market neuromodulators, mixing instructions for medical-grade chemical peels, and troubleshooting guides for at-home laser and radiofrequency devices far too powerful for untrained use.

This is not a fringe phenomenon. It is the logical, albeit hazardous, endpoint of a culture that provides unlimited access to information but insufficient access to safe, affordable, and trustworthy professional care. The desire for the results promised by aesthetic medicine is real and powerful, and when official channels feel inaccessible, a determined and resourceful individual will seek out unofficial ones.

It is, in many ways, the inevitable endpoint of a culture where beauty is democratized in theory, but still gated in practice. The demand for change is real, as seen in the new DIY movement. So is the frustration when pathways to safe, affordable, effective care feel blocked or out of reach. And as long as desire and determination are greater than trust in the system, many will keep choosing the unofficial route.

## **What’s Safe, and What Is Never Safe**

For the individual experimenting at home, the line between beneficial self-care and high-risk medical procedure can seem blurry. It is our responsibility to draw that line with absolute clarity and authority.

* **What May Be Safe (With Caution)**: Certain practices, when performed correctly and with high-quality tools, can be a safe part of an at-home routine.
  * **Topicals**: The application of skincare products, including medical-grade topicals, is the foundation of at-home care.
  * **LED Masks**: At-home Light Emitting Diode (LED) therapy masks that use red, blue, or near-infrared light are generally considered safe for home use, as their energy output is much lower than professional devices.
  * **Dermaplaning**: The gentle removal of vellus hair ("peach fuzz") and the outermost layer of dead skin cells with a sterile, single-use blade can be done safely at home, provided one follows strict hygiene protocols.
* **What Is Never Safe**: Certain procedures carry a high risk of permanent damage, including scarring, infection, vascular occlusion (which can lead to tissue death), and blindness. They require a deep understanding of facial anatomy, sterile technique, and complication management. These should _never_ be attempted at home.
  * **Injectables**: This includes all neuromodulators, dermal fillers, biostimulators, and any other substance injected beneath the skin.
  * **Deep Chemical Peels**: Peels that go beyond the superficial epidermis (like TCA or Phenol peels) can cause severe burns and scarring if not administered by a professional.
  * **Professional-Grade Energy Devices**: The at-home versions of laser, radiofrequency, or ultrasound devices are not comparable to their in-office counterparts. Attempting to use a professional-grade device without training is extremely dangerous.
  * **Threads**: Inserting polydioxanone (PDO) threads to lift tissue is a medical procedure that carries risks of infection, asymmetry, and nerve damage.

## **The Psychology Behind Aesthetic Control**

To effectively reach this community, one must understand the psychology that drives it. The DIY movement is not solely about saving money. It is deeply rooted in a desire for agency and control in an area of life that can feel vulnerable and overwhelming.

In a world saturated with idealized images and endless information, the pressure to achieve a certain aesthetic can be immense. For the obsessive researcher, the "skintellectual" gone rogue, mastering a complex procedure can feel like a powerful act of self-determination. It can be a response to feeling dismissed or misunderstood by the medical establishment, or a way to combat feelings of helplessness in the face of aging. When curiosity mixes with compulsion, and when the pursuit of information is driven by perfectionism and shame, the DIY route can present itself as an empowering solution—a way to take matters into one's own hands.
