# Acknowledgements

This book is the culmination of countless conversations, pivotal moments, and the quiet, steady work of many hands and hearts. While Vera’s name is on the cover, this work stands on the shoulders of many. I am deeply grateful to all who have walked this path with me.

First, to you, the reader. Thank you for your curiosity and for your courage. For picking up this book and choosing to engage with these questions thoughtfully. My hope is that these pages serve as a trusted companion on your journey, offering clarity and confidence as you navigate the space between how you feel and how you wish to present yourself to the world. This work is for you.

To a doctor in the United States, whose name I will not mention. When I was a trusting high school student struggling with my self-image, you let me experience malpractice firsthand. It was a painful and disillusioning chapter, but it became one of my most important lessons. You taught me what to look for in a provider by showing me what to avoid. You inadvertently set me on a path to demand a higher standard of care for myself and for others, and for that, I am unexpectedly grateful.

To the many brilliant dermatologists, surgeons, and scientists in Korea who showed me what that higher standard looks like. You revealed that any treatment, no matter how advanced, is only as good as the skill and intention of the practitioner delivering it. Thank you for allowing me to appreciate the artistry behind the science and for generously keeping me abreast of the latest developments in this fast-expanding field. You represent the bar of quality care we strive for.

To my university best friends. Brian, your belief was so absolute that you moved all the way to Korea to help me build Vera from scratch. That act of friendship remains a source of strength. Serena, you helped me translate a personal vision into the solid brand framework that guides Vera, and your contributions were instrumental to the creation of this very book.

To Adrienne, my cofounder. Thank you for trusting and believing in me, and for joining me on this journey to build an ethical and ambitious company. You are a pillar I can always lean on, and Vera would not be what it is today without your wisdom and partnership.

And lastly, but most importantly, to Vera’s early users. To fellow treatment-enthusiasts from over twenty countries whom I’ve had the privilege of befriending in clinics in Korea. You are not just users; you are our community. Thank you for resonating with Vera’s values, for believing in our mission when we were just starting, and for proving that a more thoughtful approach to aesthetic treatments is what the world is waiting for.

This book is a reflection of all these relationships and experiences—a testament to the idea that our journeys are interconnected, and that by sharing what we learn, we can lift each other up.
